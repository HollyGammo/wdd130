          <h3>Elevator Pitch - Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            Snakes are fascinating creatures that many people are terrified of.
            They have forked tongues, scales, and fangs. These reptiles are
            often misunderstood and feared because people are not well informed
            about the nature of these animals. In Pennsylvania, there are 19
            native species of snakes. 16 non-venomous species and 3 venomous.
            Knowing important facts about these snakes can replace fear with
            information and curiosity. If you encounter one of the venomous
            snakes in Pennsylvania, it can be helpful to know what to do in case
            of a bite. This site will introduces all Pennsylvania snakes, show
            the anatomy of a snake and snake facts, and then explain what to do
            in case of a snake bite.
