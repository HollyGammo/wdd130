          <h3>Elevator Pitch - Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            Snakes are fascinating creatures that many people are terrified of.
            They have forked tongues, scales, and fangs. These reptiles are
            often misunderstood and feared because people are not well informed
            about the nature of these animals. In Pennsylvania, there are 19
            native species of snakes. 16 non-venomous species and 3 venomous.
            Knowing important facts about these snakes can replace fear with
            information and curiosity. If you encounter one of the venomous
            snakes in Pennsylvania, it can be helpful to know what to do in case
            of a bite. This site will introduces all Pennsylvania snakes, show
            the anatomy of a snake and snake facts, and then explain what to do
            in case of a snake bite.

          <h3>Target Audience</h3>
          <p>
            Snakes of PA will be a site for the people living in the state of
            Pennsylvania. It will offer photos and information to anyone who
            wants to know about the different species of snakes in the area they
            live in. People who spend a lot of time outdoors, gardening,
            camping, hiking, etc. will benefit for this information.

          <h5>Anatomy of a Snake</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Scales - Snakes bodies are covered with scales. Without this
              protective armor snakes could not move over rough or hot surfaces
              like tree bark, rocks, and hot desert sand. Their scales are also
              nearly waterproof and help to keep the water out. Rough belly
              scales allow the snake to keep their grip on rough branches and to
              push off of surfaces when they need to move.
            </li>
            <li>
              Shedding - When a snake is ready to shed it’s eyes get cloudy and
              turn a blue-ish color which makes it temporarily blinded. It will
              then rub up against a rough surface like a rock to break the skin
              near the mouth and then begin to crawl and slide out of it's skin.
              Snakes shed their skin as they grow bigger.
            </li>
            <li>
              Forked Tongue - A snake uses its tongue to take in scent
              particles, effectively using its tongue to smell. These scent
              particles are flicked by the tongue up against the Jacobson’s
              organ on the roof of the mouth. The two tips of the tongue allow
              the snake to find the location of what it has smelled. Snakes use
              their forked tongue to smell and find food, find a mate, and to
              avoid predators.
            </li>
            <li>
              Teeth and Fangs -A snakes teeth are angled backwards so they can
              grab their food and walk it back into their mouths. Although most
              snakes have teeth, four rows on the top and two on the bottom, not
              all snakes have fangs. Only venomous snakes have fangs. Fangs are
              sharp, long, hollow or grooved teeth that are connected to a small
              gland in the snake's head behind its eyes. These glands produce
              venom which is injected when a snake bites.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tail Rattle - A rattlesnake has a tail made of keratin, the same
              hard substance as your fingernails. The keratin is arranged in a
              chain of interlocking rings, which are hooked together by tiny
              grooves along their edge. When vibrated, the rattle creates a
              hissing sound that warns off potential predators. It is an
              extremely effective and highly evolved predator-avoidance system.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cold Blooded - Snakes are cold-blooded animals that lack the
              ability to generate body heat internally. These animals must rely
              entirely on external sources to regulate their body temperature,
              both to stay warm and to avoid becoming overheated.
            </li>
            <li>
              How They Eat - Snakes are carnivorous. That means that they eat
              other animals. Snakes d not have the right kind of teeth to chew
              their food so they must eat their catch whole. Some snakes inject
              venom to paralyze their prey while others constrict. All snakes
              jaws are structured in such a way that it allows the mouth to open
              wider than their own body in order to swallow their prey whole.
            </li>
            <li>
              Eyes - Most snakes have poor eyesight. Vipers, pythons and boas
              have holes on their faces called pit organs, which contain a
              membrane that can detect infrared radiation from warm bodies up to
              one meter away. At night, the pit organs allow snakes to 'see' an
              image of their prey — as an infrared camera does — giving them a
              unique extra sense.

            <li>Stay calm.</li>
            <li>Call 911 immediately to be evaluated.</li>
            <li>
              Take off anything constricting the area, such as a ring or watch.
            </li>
            <li>
              Elevate the bite. Position the affected area at or above heart
              level.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make note of the time the bite occured and outline the swollen and
              red area with a marker. This will aid the doctors with treating
              the bite.
            </li>
            <li>Go to the emergency room as soon as possible.</li>

          <h6>What NOT TO DO For a Snake Bite</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>DON'T apply a tourniquet or a constriction band.</li>
            <li>DON'T apply ice, it can cause tissue damage.</li>
            <li>DON'T apply heat.</li>
            <li>
              DON'T cut the affected area and attempt to suck the venom out.
              This can cause infection.
            </li>
            <li>DON'T apply any type of lotions or ointments.</li>
