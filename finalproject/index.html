          <p>
            Snakes are fascinating creatures that many people are terrified of.
            They have forked tongues, scales, and fangs. These reptiles are
            often misunderstood and feared because people are not well informed
            about the nature of these animals. In Pennsylvania, there are 21
            native species of snakes. 18 non-venomous species and 3 venomous.
            Knowing important facts about these snakes can replace fear with
            information and curiosity. If you encounter one of the venomous
            snakes in Pennsylvania, it can be helpful to know what to do in case
            of a bite. This site will introduce all Pennsylvania snakes, show
            the anatomy of a snake, and then explain what to do in case of a
            snake bite.

          <h3 class="sec-two">Venomous Snakes of Pennsylvania</h3>
          <p>
            There are three venomous snake species in Pennsylvania, the
            Copperhead, the Timber Rattle Snake, and the Massasauga Rattle
            Snake. Some key physical differences between venomous and
            non-venomous snakes help with identification. Native venomous snakes
            in Pennsylvania have an indentation or pit on each side of the head
            between the eye and nostril, a vertically elliptical eye pupil
            resembling that of a cat, and a single row of scales on the
            underside of the tail. Nonvenomous snakes in Pennsylvania do not
            possess facial pits, have round eye pupils and a double row of
            scales on the underside of the tail. The head shape of Copperheads
            and rattlesnakes are flattened and triangular because of the venom
            glands on either side of the snakeâ€™s head.
          </p>

          <h3 class="sec-three">The Copperhead Snake</h3>
          <p>
            Copperhead snakes are commonly seen in Pennsylvania and are found
            throughout the state. Of the three venomous snakes in the state,
            they're also the most likely to bite. However, their venom is
            relatively mild, and their bites are rarely fatal for humans. These
            snakes get their name from their copper-red heads. These snakes are
            pit vipers, like rattlesnakes and water moccasins. Pit vipers have
            heat-sensory pits between eye and nostril on each side of head,
            which are able to detect minute differences in temperatures so that
            the snakes can accurately strike the source of heat, which is often
            potential prey.

          <h3 class="sec-four">The Timber Rattlesnake</h3>
          <p>
            Timber rattlesnakes are large pit-vipers and have a distinctive
            rattle on the tail and a black, velvety colored tail. Because of the
            distinctive black tail, these snakes are often called Velvet tails.
            Black bands run down the entire body to the tail in a chevron
            pattern. These venomous snakes are found throughout the state, with
            heavy populations in the mid region.

          <p>
            The eastern massasauga rattlesnake has been listed as a threatened
            species under the Endangered Species Act. Massasaugas are small
            snakes with thick bodies, heart-shaped heads and vertical pupils.
            The average length of an adult is about 2 feet. Adult massasaugas
            are gray or light brown with large, light-edged chocolate brown
            blotches on the back and smaller blotches on the sides.

          <h2 class="sec-six">Non-Venomous Snakes</h2>
          <p>
            The other 18 species of snakes native to Pennsylvania are
            non-venomous. These snakes tend to be found near cover such as
            fallen logs, brush piles, rock walls, abandoned house foundations or
            rock ledges, where snakes may be resting or lying in wait for prey.
            The following are pictures of these snakes.
