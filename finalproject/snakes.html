        <section>
          <h3 class="scales">Scales</h3>
          <p>
            Snakes bodies are covered with scales. Without this protective armor
            snakes could not move over rough or hot surfaces like tree bark,
            rocks, and hot desert sand. Their scales are also nearly waterproof
            and help to keep the water out. Rough belly scales allow the snake
            to keep their grip on rough branches and to push off of surfaces
            when they need to move.

          <h3 class="shedding">Shedding</h3>
          <p>
            When a snake is ready to shed it’s eyes get cloudy and turn a
            blue-ish color which makes it temporarily blinded. It will then rub
            up against a rough surface like a rock to break the skin near the
            mouth and then begin to crawl and slide out of it's skin. Snakes
            shed their skin as they grow bigger.

          <h3 class="tongue">Forked Tongue</h3>
          <p>
            A snake uses its tongue to take in scent particles, effectively
            using its tongue to smell. These scent particles are flicked by the
            tongue up against the Jacobson’s organ on the roof of the mouth. The
            two tips of the tongue allow the snake to find the location of what
            it has smelled. Snakes use their forked tongue to smell and find
            food, find a mate, and to avoid predators.

          <h3 class="fangs">Teeth and Fangs</h3>
          <p>
            A snakes teeth are angled backwards so they can grab their food and
            walk it back into their mouths. Although most snakes have teeth,
            four rows on the top and two on the bottom, not all snakes have
            fangs. Only venomous snakes have fangs. Fangs are sharp, long,
            hollow or grooved teeth that are connected to a small gland in the
            snake's head behind its eyes. These glands produce venom which is
            injected when a snake bites.

          <h3 class="rattle">Tail Rattle</h3>
          <p>
            A rattlesnake has a tail made of keratin, the same hard substance as
            your fingernails. The keratin is arranged in a chain of interlocking
            rings, which are hooked together by tiny grooves along their edge.
            When vibrated, the rattle creates a hissing sound that warns off
            potential predators. It is an extremely effective and highly evolved
            predator-avoidance system.

          <h3 class="cold">Cold Blooded</h3>
          <p>
            Snakes are cold-blooded animals that lack the ability to generate
            body heat internally. These animals must rely entirely on external
            sources to regulate their body temperature, both to stay warm and to
            avoid becoming overheated.

          <h3 class="eat">How They Eat</h3>
          <p>
            Snakes are carnivorous. That means that they eat other animals.
            Snakes d not have the right kind of teeth to chew their food so they
            must eat their catch whole. Some snakes inject venom to paralyze
            their prey while others constrict. All snakes jaws are structured in
            such a way that it allows the mouth to open wider than their own
            body in order to swallow their prey whole.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3 class="eyes">Eyes</h3>
          <p>
            Most snakes have poor eyesight. Vipers, pythons and boas have holes
            on their faces called pit organs, which contain a membrane that can
            detect infrared radiation from warm bodies up to one meter away. At
            night, the pit organs allow snakes to 'see' an image of their prey —
            as an infrared camera does — giving them a unique extra sense.
