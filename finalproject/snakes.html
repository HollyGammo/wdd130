              <h3>Scales</h3>
              <p>
                Snakes bodies are covered with scales. Without this protective
                armor snakes could not move over rough or hot surfaces like tree
                bark, rocks, and hot desert sand. Their scales are also nearly
                waterproof and help to keep the water out. Rough belly scales
                allow the snake to keep their grip on rough branches and to push
                off of surfaces when they need to move.

              <p>
                When a snake is ready to shed it’s eyes get cloudy and turn a
                blue-ish color which makes it temporarily blinded. It will then
                rub up against a rough surface like a rock to break the skin
                near the mouth and then begin to crawl and slide out of it's
                skin. Snakes shed their skin as they grow bigger.

              <h3>Forked Tongue</h3>
              <p>
                A snake uses its tongue to take in scent particles, effectively
                using its tongue to smell. These scent particles are flicked by
                the tongue up against the Jacobson’s organ on the roof of the
                mouth. The two tips of the tongue allow the snake to find the
                location of what it has smelled. Snakes use their forked tongue
                to smell and find food, find a mate, and to avoid predators.

                A snakes teeth are angled backwards so they can grab their food
                and walk it back into their mouths. Although most snakes have
                teeth, four rows on the top and two on the bottom, not all
                snakes have fangs. Only venomous snakes have fangs. Fangs are
                sharp, long, hollow or grooved teeth that are connected to a
                small gland in the snake's head behind its eyes. These glands
                produce venom which is injected when a snake bites.

                A rattlesnake has a tail made of keratin, the same hard
                substance as your fingernails. The keratin is arranged in a
                chain of interlocking rings, which are hooked together by tiny
                grooves along their edge. When vibrated, the rattle creates a
                hissing sound that warns off potential predators. It is an
                extremely effective and highly evolved predator-avoidance
                system.

              <h3>How They Eat</h3>
              <p>
                Snakes are carnivorous. That means that they eat other animals.
                Snakes don't have the right kind of teeth to chew their food so
                they must eat their catch whole. Some snakes inject venom to
                paralyze their prey while others constrict. All snakes jaws are
                structured in such a way that it allows the mouth to open wider
                than their own body in order to swallow their prey whole.

              <h3>Eyes</h3>
              <p>
                Most snakes have poor eyesight. Vipers, pythons and boas have
                holes on their faces called pit organs, which contain a membrane
                that can detect infrared radiation from warm bodies up to one
                meter away. At night, the pit organs allow snakes to 'see' an
                image of their prey — as an infrared camera does — giving them a
                unique extra sense.

              <h4>More Interesting Facts About Snakes</h4>
              <p>
                Snakes, whether you love them or fear them they are fascinating.
                They live without limbs, survive in a wide range of habitats
                throughout the world and come in all colours and sizes. The
                smallest, the Barbados Thread Snake, is just 4 inches long. The
                largest species of snake is the Green Anaconda which can reach
                over 20 ft. long.

              <h5>How many species of snake are there in the world?</h5>
              <p>
                Did you know there are over 3,000 species of snake? You can find
                them in most places on earth, except Antarctica, Iceland,
                Ireland, Greenland and New Zealand. They are not all venomous,
                though. Most are harmless. Only around 600 species are venomous
                and, far fewer can hurt humans.

              <h5>Can snakes regulate their body temperature?</h5>
              <p>
                Snakes are cold-blooded. This means that their body temperature
                changes according to their environment. A warm blooded animals
                body temperature remains constant regardless of the weather
                outside. To survive, snakes living in colder climates hibernate
                in winter and come out in summer when they can use the suns heat
                to keep warm.

              <h5>Do snakes lay eggs?</h5>
              <p>
                While around 70% of snake are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs,
                there are actually three methods of giving birth. Viviparous
                snakes give birth to live young, while ovoviviparous snakes grow
                their young in eggs that remain in the body of the female. Young
                are born live and the female keeps the egg inside of her.

              <h5>Do I need to fear snakes?</h5>
              <p>
                It's true that some species of snake are venomous and capable of
                killing humans, however, the majority are harmless. Snakes are
                very unlikely to intentionally attack humans and avoid being
                seen as much as possible. Snakes attack when they feel
                threatened – venom is a survival mechanism.
