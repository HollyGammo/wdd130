    <p>
      I am <strong>new</strong> to the world of web design and coding. I will need
       a lot of <em>help</em> and am a bit scared I won't be able to understand 
       everything. This lab has helped me fix a few of my initial mistakes in the 
       setup process and I hope to keep learning so I can keep up. I enjoy graphic 
       design and I want to learn how to put together websites so I can do that on 
       my own in the future.
