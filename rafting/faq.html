              No rafting experience is required. This river has several rapid

              hard to navigate.

            <h5>HOW OLD DO YOU HAVE TO BE?</h5>
            <p>
              There is no set age requirement for your trip down the river.
              Everyone must sign a waiver to participate, but the river is calm
              enough for all ages to enjoy.

            <h5>DO I NEED TO KNOW HOW TO SWIM?</h5>
            <p>
              No. You will have a life jacket to wear so you will not need to
              know how to swim. The river is calm enough that not many people
              get thrown from the raft.

          <section class="l">
            <h5>WHAT CAN I BRING WITH ME?</h5>

              We recommend that you bring a water resistant pouch or bag to put
              cell phones, keys, etc. to keep them safe and so they don't get
              lost.

          <section class="m">
            <h5>HOW LONG IS THE TRIP DOWN THE RIVER?</h5>
            <p>
              The section of the river that we run usually ends up being about a
              four hour trip, depending upon how high and fast the river is
              running.
