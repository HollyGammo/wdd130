        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The Green River Rafting Company plans adventures for the 
            whole family to enjoy. We also like to aid youth groups 
            in trips down the river. Our focus is on a safe adventure 
            on the river for everyone. The section of the river we run
            is mostly calm with several rapid areas, making it enjoyable
            and safe for all age groups.
