          <h3>Audience</h3>
          <p>
            The Green River Rafting Company plans adventures for the whole
            family to enjoy. We also like to aid youth groups in trips down the
            river. Our focus is on a safe adventure on the river for everyone.
            The section of the river we run is mostly calm with several rapid
            areas, making it enjoyable and safe for all age groups.
