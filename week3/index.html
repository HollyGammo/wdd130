        <h1>Life's Better on the River!</h1>
        <p>
          The Green River Rafting Company plans adventures for the whole family
          to enjoy. We also like to aid youth groups in their adventures down
          the river. Our focus is on a safe outing on the river for everyone.
          The section of the river we run is mostly calm with several rapid
          areas, making it enjoyable and safe for all age groups.
