          <p>
            The Green River Rafting Company plans adventures for the whole
            family to enjoy. We also like to aid youth groups in their
            adventures down the river. Our focus is on a safe outing on the
            river for everyone. The section of the river we run is mostly calm
            with several rapid areas, making it enjoyable and safe for all age
            groups.
